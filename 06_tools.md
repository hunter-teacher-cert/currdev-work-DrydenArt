## Desribe 2 technological tools you currently use in your classroom:
### **Name:** Notepad
- **General purpose:**  Web Development. 
- **Class:**  Graphic Design, ART 117 Concurrent Enrollment with TC3. 
- **How it's used in class:** I will use notepad to introduce HTML and CSS for Web Development in this class during the second semester.  Students begin with one document to learn some basic HTML, and later CSS.  Then they'll learn how to create and link a CSS document to their index page.  Later, students will add/link pages as their knowledge base improves.  Each skill set will be developed by creating new pages as mini-lessons to teach and practice various skills. 
- **Why I've selected it:** I've selected notepad because it's included on our machines, it's free, I don't have to wait for my IT department to get Ed Law 2D approval and it's something that students most likely have access to at home on their own computers.  Students can easily transfer this to TextEdit if they work on a Mac at home. Another main reason is privacy for students as their practicing and learning new skills.  They won't have a footprint of published weird sites used for the purposes of practice...it's offline and completely old school.

### **Name:** P5.js
- **General purpose:**  Simple designs, drawings and games created with JavaScript. 
- **Class:** Digital Media Arts, a foundation level art course which serves as 1 credit of Art/Music required for graduation.    
- **How it's used in class:** This will be used as an introduction to programming as an art tool.  Currently, due to the underdeveloped CS available across our district, this may be the first time students will be exposed to programming.  I'm hoping to use this with the P5 editor since it's easy to work with and has supports built in.  Students will work on using JavaScript to make designs, and simple games.   
- **Why I've selected it:** I've selected this because many of my colleagues in the Hunter College program have highly recommended it.  It's a great introductory level programming interface, and it fits into my curriculum as an art course.  Additionally, I hope to develop the web development unit from Graphic Design to include JavaScript interactivity.  Many students who take Digital Media Arts tend to get interested in taking the Graphic Design class.  Their work using P5.js will support their continued web development skills in the next level.  It will create a foundation for continued study.
