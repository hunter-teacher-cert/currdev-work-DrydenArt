# General Information
## Course: Web Development unit in Graphic Design
  I've never had the luxury of teaching with pre-packaged curriculum in the Arts.  We follow the standards and develop all of our own curriculum from scratch.  As a result, the concept of pre-packaged curriculum is a new one for me, and one that feels very foreign.

  Following the summer course work classes this year, I had the opportunity for curriculum writing to develop an HTML/CSS unit in Graphic Design that I hope to teach in the spring semester of 2023.  While developing my curriculum, I referenced a variety of sources from Code.org, W3Schools, replit,  Mouse.org, Runestone Academy, and Raspberry Pi code club.

# Compare the Curriculum
## My Curated Curriculum:
  The curriculum that I developed ([Web Development Scope and Sequence.pdf](https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/currdev-work-DrydenArt/files/9579409/Web.Development.Scope.and.Sequence.pdf)) is geared toward high school students who are pursuing a 5-Unit Sequence in the Arts for graduation.  Students in our district don't have much access to any kind of programming yet, as we're only now just developing courses in computer science.  My approach is to start with basics, build sequential  skill building and resource management,  to empower students to design their own personal web portfolio by the end of the course.  The lesson begin with basic skill development, and move toward skill application by the end.  The curriculum focused on a scope and sequence as a starting point.  From there, I pooled ideas from all the various resources listed above to put together skills that would be important for a studnent in a Graphic Design class to know before applying thier skills to a personal design. I worked on creating my own lesson templates and code skeletons for students to work with, using a simple notepad app on the device.  
## Comparisson Curriculum:
  The curriculum that I am focusing on in the comparisson is [Code.org's unit on Web Development](https://studio.code.org/s/csd2-2022).  This has a very unified interface and comes with all the teacher materials needed to teach the concepts.  Students have an online interface where they can practice writing in HTML and CSS with sequential lessons and activities.  
  
## Major Differences:
  One major difference is the visual cohesion of the Code.org.  The interface and all of the supporting documents are visually connected, and the flow and format of all the content enable students to more easily  navigate through the activities, access information, track their progress and get basic feedback.  The fact that this curriculum already has the sequence built in means that important steps or concepts won't be overlooked.  Since my curriculum draws from many different resources, the same level of student independence may not be achieved as quickly.  However, while mine is varied, it does focus on specific exercises and projects where students have some creative control over the content they create, not just pre-packaged lessons.  
  
## Major Similiarities:
A major similarity is that both are arranged through sequential progression from basic to more advanced. Both use a range of approaches for teaching, practicing, problem solving and accessing resources. 

## Comparative Streangths & Weaknesses:
I think one thing that Code.org does more sensibly than mine is introduce CSS to HTML at a point when it makes sense, and they do it in a way that helps students differentiate the two, but show how they are connected. 

## Adoption? 
At first when I was thinking about developing this unit for the Graphic Design class, I never considered using a pre-packaged curriculum because I'd never had that experience as a teacher.  However, once I worked with my team in week 2 in looking at and comparing different curricula, and being able to ask my group more about how they approach things, I realized that pre-packaged curriculum can be a very good way to start.   And Code.org's curriculum offers so much for the teaching and learning environment.  It doesn't mean I can't still modify it as I go through it, or once I get inspired by a student's insights.  I can still create my own end products where students are using the skills for "real-world" applications.  So, yes, I would consider using it, or even parts of it like the beginning of the unit to make sure concepts are covered well.
