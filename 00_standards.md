# Session 00: 09/01
## Assignment:
  * Pick 2 specific NY CS standards and describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your selected standards, explain how.
  * You can use the same lesson/task/assignment for both, or different ones.

## Lesson Focus: 
### Lesson Title: 
Introduction to Processing, a lesson developed during the Summer Methods course
### Link to the GitHub lesson: 
https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/cohort-3-summer-work-DrydenArt/blob/master/methods/11_lessons/lesson00/00_Intro_Processing.md

## NY CS Standards for the Unplugged Activities:
### 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Standard 1, Modelling and Simulation
### 4-6.CT.6 Computational Thinking, Standard 6, Algorithms and Programming
Prior to this lesson, students engage in an activity (Steps in Making a PBJ) that allow them to begin to think about how to write directions, test them and then modify/improve them.  This is an important modelling and simulation activity that resembles creating algorithms in computational thinking. The act of writing and rewriting for clarity and efficiency allows students to practice algorithms and programming. 

## NY CS Standards for the Lesson Activities:
### 7-8.CT.9 Computational Thinking, Standard 9, Algorithms and Programming
### 9-12.CT.9 Computational Thinking, Standard 9 Algorithms and Programming
Students are given time to read through provided code and make preditions about what the program will do.  They can trace through the steps by creating a drawing of what the outcome should be.  Once they have a theory for the program's outcome, they can begin to explore and test various inputs, finding and debugging errors, and discovering boundaries of input values.
