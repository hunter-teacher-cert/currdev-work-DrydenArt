# Assignment: Language 
## Processing for Digital Media Arts - a foundation level art course required for graduation 
I'm selecting Processing to incorporate into my Digtial Media Arts course.  However, I'm thinking that p5.js may be a better fit based on where DMA fits within a sequence of digital art courses offered within our department.  This is a precursor to Graphic Design which will cover a unit in HTML and CSS.  Hopefully in the future, it will spur the development of a JavaScript course.  

## Rationale and Background:
### What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
The course is Digital Media Arts.  This foundation level art course serves as the one Art graduation credit required in NYS. This course is predominantly 9th graders, however there are students from grades 9-12 enrolled in the course since some students aren't able to fit in thier credit during 9th grade.  These students are typically not art majors (though some are), and are merely taking the course to complete a requirement.  At this time, most of the students enrolled don't have any experience with programming or any type of computer science since our district is just beginning to build computer science into the K-12 curriculum. 

### What is the language?
The language that seems most appropriate for this level and this type of course is Processing (though in reality I will most likely incorporate p5.js as mentioned above).  

### How does one write & run code in this language?
Processing is downloaded to the local computer, and run using the Processing Integrated Development Environment (typed out here in hopes that someday I will memorize this acronym).  

The complexity of the Processing syntax is relatively complex as it's based on Java.  However, the IDE allows for it to be mostly accessible and provides many types of resources, examples and support materials.  

## Strengths & Weaknesses
### How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
I feel that I could use the strengths in this class by starting with highly supported activities where students become familiar with how to control the basics of the languges, learn how to debug together and how to find and use resources.  Once students have a foundation in navigating this program, I would begin to provide them wiht challenges where they have to solve|write|debug more indepenendently.  The program is flexible enough with so many resources, that students could easily move from dependent to independent within a unit or two. 

### How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
Many students who join this class may not have any interest in the content.  They also may not have very strong academic skills - some of my students come to me with little to no literacy in English, let alone in coding.  My approach to teaching Processing would be similar to teaching how to use software or use the design process.  I'd start with tapping into the knowledge of the group to build fluency, then slowly provide students will more independent work once they have developed a foundation of fluency.  I would group students with varied abilities to allow them to learn from and teach each other. 

## Why Processing? Why DMA?
As a digital art making IDE, it seems like the most accessible language for a class called Digital Media Arts.  DMA is designed to introduce students to all kinds of digital art making tools, and this is another tool in laying the foundation for students to understand and experience the role that visual art can play in the world.  It's a perfect match where the DMA curriculum supports CS and the CS supports DMA.

## Processing
I have had guest artists introduce basic Processing experiments as part of an analog game design unit within Digital Media Arts.  It was a great add-on component of the larger unit, but it was a lot for students to try to pick up as a side project.  It was a huge undertaking and we had to really scaffold the mini-coding unit.  

## JavaScript
I really want to learn more about the language because I see it an an important progression following my Graphic Design course in which students will learn HTML and CSS.  However, I feel that it could stand on it's own as it's own course either in advanced website interactivity, mobile app design and/or game design. So I decided not to use it as a focus for this assignment.
