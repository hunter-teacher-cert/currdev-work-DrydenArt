## New Course in Mobile App Design and Development: 
A new course that I would like to teach at Dryden High School is Mobile App Design and Development.  In this course, students will learn how to apply JavaScript, with HTML and CSS to design mobile apps to solve real problems.   In referencing the CodeHS.org's syllabus for the course, students will explore why apps are important and begin developing the basic components such as buttons, text boxes, navigating multiple screens, layout and images.  Students will engage in small units of content followed by a mini-design project to provide an opportunity to apply the skills learned.  The course will build content sequentially in order to scaffold learning as content becomes more complex, such as working with conditionals and conversion syntax.  In my course, I would develop multiple project assessments that students would develop to practice skills throughout the course.  I would also add the aspect of designing for a client, and as a culminating event/assessment students would build an app to solve a local or global problem that they develop in response to a "client" or their own research.  I would also add an exhibition component to the course so students can present and promote thier ideas and designs. Students would present their designs locally as well as submit them to various competitons.

## Target Audience:
The primary target audience for this course is HS Art Students who are pursuing thier 5-Unit Sequence in the Arts for an Advanced Designation Diploma.  However, I'd also develop the course in such a way that any student who meets the prerequisites can enroll in the course.  

## Where does it fit?
* Based on the sequence that we currently have in the Dryden Highschool Art Departments, students would initially take Digital Media Arts, a foundation level course.  In this course students will be fluent in programs such as the Adobe Creative Cloud software, 3D printing, the design process, and p5.js for digital art and game design.
* The second course students would take is Graphic Design in which the second semester will introduce HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* And finally, the Mobile App Design and Development Course! 

Ideally, the second semester of Graphic Design would become it's own course in Web Development so the course sequence would look like: 
* Digital Media Arts ----> Graphic Design ----> Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) ----> Mobile App Design and Development
